    "content": "I recently joined a program called [Nvidia Inception](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups) and successfully entered after going through several processes. There are several benefits we can get if we participate in this program, you can see [here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/?deeplink=expertise-faq--2#expertise-faq-item-22b9adb3d1), includes AWS credits.\n\nToday, I will tell you:\n\n- How I obtained $10,000\n- Tips and tricks to avoid rejection\n- Other useful information for Startup Founders or individuals looking to scale but needing capital for infrastructure\n---\n### 1. AWS Active Program\n\nHowever, initially, I didn't know about this program directly. Instead, I found it through the [AWS Active Credits page](https://aws.amazon.com/startups/credits) \n![aws-startups](/img/aws-active.webp \"\")\n\nThere are two programs: \n- AWS Active Founders ($1k)\n- AWS Active Portfolio (up to $100k). \n\nOf course, getting the Active Founder credits ($1k) is much easier and faster, as we only need to create an AWS account and enter information about the product we want to create.\nHowever, this time I will discuss how to get up to $100k 👑 through the AWS Active Portfolio program. \n\nTo get it, we need to be on the following list of featured AWS active providers: [Active Provider list](https://aws.amazon.com/activate/portfolio-detail/)\n![aws-portfolio](/img/aws-active-featured.webp \"\")\n\nYes, those are the rules. The way to enter is either as an individual or as a team/company by registering or even being directly invited. Then we will automatically be able to apply for AWS credits of up to $100k.\n\nBut, don't worry, I've done some research on this and found that the most suitable program for us **solo founders** or **small startup** teams is the Nvidia Inception program that I mentioned at the beginning. So, how did I manage to register? Let's discuss it further :D.\n\n`I want to give a little disclaimer before continuing: please only apply to join if you have a serious project. Even if there's no profit/revenue yet, we need to thoroughly prepare several things related to the product we're creating, such as a brief description of the project, its field, and target market. If we're not serious, it might be better to just apply for the AWS Active Founder program, before our application gets rejected.`\n\n### 2. Nvidia Inception Program Application\n\n#### 2.1 Filling in the application form\n\nIt all started on May 13, 2024, when I applied for this program. I didn't have high hopes because I had applied for similar programs several times before and was mostly rejected.\n![nvidia-intro](/img/13th-may-email.png \"\")\n\nFor the application process, it's actually similar to applying for AWS Active Founder ($1k). We're asked to fill in personal data, project/company profile such as problems & solutions that we are going to solve with our product, our competitors, some personal information related to work experience (I don't know why), and also the Nvidia technologies that will be used in the project.\n\n#### 2.2 Receiving the response + follow up detailed information\n\nLong story short, I received an email from the Nvidia Inception team 14 days later and was asked to answer a few questions. I'll go ahead and include an image with my answers filled in, which you can use as a reference :D\n![email-response](/img/email-response.png \"\")\n\nAnd finally, after 1 month, I received this email 🎉🎉🎉\n\n![nvidia-response](/img/nvidia-response.png \"\")\n\n### 3. Applying for AWS Active Portfolio\n\nAfter receiving the response from Nvidia, I started to apply for the AWS Active Portfolio program. But, before I do that, we need to request a benefits letter to Nvidia Inception via their websites. I did that and received a response within a few days.\n\n![aws-benefits](/img/nvidia-inception-benefits.png \"\")\n\nAfter that, I immediately submitted it to the AWS console that was already connected to the active AWS account. I made the submission and entered the org id that had been provided via email. But before that, pay attention to the following (very important):\n\n- In the valuation field, don't choose \"No Valuation\" (I tried it because I thought my product wasn't profitable yet, but the application was rejected, perhaps because it wasn't considered serious. Fortunately, I could reapply).\n- Make sure the email used for the NVIDIA Inception application is the same as the email used for the AWS active account and AWS console.\n- Don't spread secrets like the org-id, sell accounts, or do other irresponsible things.\n\nYou might ask, why shouldn't we choose \"no valuation\"? What I know is that Valuation != Profit. Even if our product doesn't have a profit yet, our assets like our product should still have value, right?\nFor the rest, we just need to wait, and if the application is accepted, we will receive an email like this.\n\n\n### 4. Redeem Aws Credits\n\nThen congratulations: you will get $10k for free on your AWS console.\n\n![nvidia-response](/img/aws-response-credits.png \"\")\n\nActivate credits are applied incrementally up to the Activate credit maximum of $100,000 (note: credits do not stack). Your credits must increase over time until you reach the $100,000 lifetime maximum. Therefore, you cannot apply for a package that is smaller than or equal to a previously activated package. \n\nNot only that, you can also get the [AWS Exclusive Offer](https://aws.amazon.com/startups/learn/aeo) such as free credits from Vercel, Datadog, and many other free and discounted items because you've become an AWS active member.\n\nPerhaps that's all I can convey. If you have any questions about anything, you can contact me directly via Twitter: [@fahreziadhaa](https://twitter.com/fahreziadhaa)",

Load Balancing: Traffic Control for Servers\n* **In a nutshell**: Distributing work evenly so no server has a meltdown\n* **Why it matters**: It's like having multiple cashiers during rush hour – faster service for everyone!\n\n### 3. Caching: The Art of Being Lazy (Efficiently)\n* **What it does**: Remembers frequently used data for quick access\n* **Why it matters**: Imagine if your brain cached the location of your keys!\n\n### 4. Database Sharding: Divide and Conquer\n* **The gist**: Splitting a huge database into manageable chunks\n* **Why it matters**: It's like organizing your closet – finding things becomes way easier!\n\n### 5. CAP Theorem: The \"Pick Two\" Dilemma\n* **The choice**: Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance – choose wisely!\n* **Why it matters**: It's the \"Fast, Good, Cheap – pick two\" of distributed systems\n\n### 6. Microservices: Small is the New Big\n* **What it is**: Breaking down your app into bite-sized, independent services\n* **Why it matters**: It's like LEGO – easier to build, change, and fix!\n\n### 7. API Gateway: The Ultimate Bouncer\n* **Job description**: Guards your APIs, handles security, directs traffic\n* **Why it matters**: Think of it as a smart receptionist for your digital business\n\n### 8. Eventual Consistency: Patience is a Virtue\n* **In simple terms**: Data will be consistent... eventually\n* **Why it matters**: It's like gossip – everyone will get the right info, just not instantly\n\n### 9. CDN: The Global Coffee Shop Chain\n* **What it does**: Puts your content closer to users, everywhere\n* **Why it matters**: Faster load times = happier users = more business\n\n### 10. Containerization: Pack It, Ship It, Run It\n* **The concept**: Wrap up your app with everything it needs\n* **Why it matters**: It's like a TV dinner, but for code – consistent everywhere!\n\nRemember, understanding these concepts is like learning the rules of the road. You might not use them all every day, but knowing them makes you a better driver (or in this case, a better developer)!",

    "content": "I recently joined a program called [Nvidia Inception](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups) and successfully entered after going through several processes. There are several benefits we can get if we participate in this program, you can see [here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/?deeplink=expertise-faq--2#expertise-faq-item-22b9adb3d1), includes AWS credits.\n\nToday, I will tell you:\n\n- How I obtained $10,000\n- Tips and tricks to avoid rejection\n- Other useful information for Startup Founders or individuals looking to scale but needing capital for infrastructure\n---\n### 1. AWS Active Program\n\nHowever, initially, I didn't know about this program directly. Instead, I found it through the [AWS Active Credits page](https://aws.amazon.com/startups/credits)\n![aws-startups](/img/aws-active.webp \"\")\n\nThere are two programs:\n- AWS Active Founders ($1k)\n- AWS Active Portfolio (up to $100k).\n\nOf course, getting the Active Founder credits ($1k) is much easier and faster, as we only need to create an AWS account and enter information about the product we want to create.\nHowever, this time I will discuss how to get up to $100k 👑 through the AWS Active Portfolio program.\n\nTo get it, we need to be on the following list of featured AWS active providers: [Active Provider list](https://aws.amazon.com/activate/portfolio-detail/)\n![aws-portfolio](/img/aws-active-featured.webp \"\")\n\nYes, those are the rules. The way to enter is either as an individual or as a team/company by registering or even being directly invited. Then we will automatically be able to apply for AWS credits of up to $100k.\n\nBut, don't worry, I've done some research on this and found that the most suitable program for us **solo founders** or **small startup** teams is the Nvidia Inception program that I mentioned at the beginning. So, how did I manage to register? Let's discuss it further :D.\n\n`I want to give a little disclaimer before continuing: please only apply to join if you have a serious project. Even if there's no profit/revenue yet, we need to thoroughly prepare several things related to the product we're creating, such as a brief description of the project, its field, and target market. If we're not serious, it might be better to just apply for the AWS Active Founder program, before our application gets rejected.`\n\n### 2. Nvidia Inception Program Application\n\n#### 2.1 Filling in the application form\n\nIt all started on May 13, 2024, when I applied for this program. I didn't have high hopes because I had applied for similar programs several times before and was mostly rejected.\n![nvidia-intro](/img/13th-may-email.png \"\")\n\nFor the application process, it's actually similar to applying for AWS Active Founder ($1k). We're asked to fill in personal data, project/company profile such as problems & solutions that we are going to solve with our product, our competitors, some personal information related to work experience (I don't know why), and also the Nvidia technologies that will be used in the project.\n\n#### 2.2 Receiving the response + follow up detailed information\n\nLong story short, I received an email from the Nvidia Inception team 14 days later and was asked to answer a few questions. I'll go ahead and include an image with my answers filled in, which you can use as a reference :D\n![email-response](/img/email-response.png \"\")\n\nAnd finally, after 1 month, I received this email 🎉🎉🎉\n\n![nvidia-response](/img/nvidia-response.png \"\")\n\n### 3. Applying for AWS Active Portfolio\n\nAfter receiving the response from Nvidia, I started to apply for the AWS Active Portfolio program. But, before I do that, we need to request a benefits letter to Nvidia Inception via their websites. I did that and received a response within a few days.\n\n![aws-benefits](/img/nvidia-inception-benefits.png \"\")\n\nAfter that, I immediately submitted it to the AWS console that was already connected to the active AWS account. I made the submission and entered the org id that had been provided via email. But before that, pay attention to the following (very important):\n\n- In the valuation field, don't choose \"No Valuation\" (I tried it because I thought my product wasn't profitable yet, but the application was rejected, perhaps because it wasn't considered serious. Fortunately, I could reapply).\n- Make sure the email used for the NVIDIA Inception application is the same as the email used for the AWS active account and AWS console.\n- Don't spread secrets like the org-id, sell accounts, or do other irresponsible things.\n\nYou might ask, why shouldn't we choose \"no valuation\"? What I know is that Valuation != Profit. Even if our product doesn't have a profit yet, our assets like our product should still have value, right?\nFor the rest, we just need to wait, and if the application is accepted, we will receive an email like this.\n\n\n### 4. Redeem Aws Credits\n\nThen congratulations: you will get $10k for free on your AWS console.\n\n![nvidia-response](/img/aws-response-credits.png \"\")\n\nActivate credits are applied incrementally up to the Activate credit maximum of $100,000 (note: credits do not stack). Your credits must increase over time until you reach the $100,000 lifetime maximum. Therefore, you cannot apply for a package that is smaller than or equal to a previously activated package.\n\nNot only that, you can also get the [AWS Exclusive Offer](https://aws.amazon.com/startups/learn/aeo) such as free credits from Vercel, Datadog, and many other free and discounted items because you've become an AWS active member.\n\nPerhaps that's all I can convey.
