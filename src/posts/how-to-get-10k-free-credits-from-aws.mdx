I recently joined a program called [Nvidia Inception](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups) and successfully entered after going through several processes. There are several benefits we can get if we participate in this program, including:

* Credits for Nvidia cloud partners
* Access to venture capital
* Discounts on Nvidia technology & services
* Learning materials & content related to machine learning
* And much more, you can see [here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/?deeplink=expertise-faq--2#expertise-faq-item-22b9adb3d1).

However, initially, I didn't know about this program directly. Instead, I found it through the [AWS Active Credits page](https://aws.amazon.com/startups/credits)

There are two programs: 
- AWS Active Founders ($1k)
- AWS Active Portfolio (up to $100k). 

Of course, getting the Active Founder credits ($1k) is much easier and faster, as we only need to create an AWS account and enter information about the product we want to create.
However, this time I will discuss how to get up to $100k ðŸ‘‘ through the AWS Active Portfolio program. 

To get it, we need to be on the following list of featured AWS active providers: [Active Provider list](https://aws.amazon.com/activate/portfolio-detail/)

Yes, those are the rules. The way to enter is either as an individual or as a team/company by registering or even being directly invited. Then we will automatically be able to apply for AWS credits of up to $100k.

But, don't worry, I've done some research on this and found that the most suitable program for us **solo founders** or **small startup** teams is the Nvidia Inception program that I mentioned at the beginning. So, how did I manage to register? Let's discuss it further :D.

It all started on May 13, 2024, when I applied for this program. I didn't have high hopes because I had applied for similar programs several times before and was mostly rejected.
